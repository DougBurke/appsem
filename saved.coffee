# A comment on saved times, used in both savePub and saveSearch.
#
# Approximate the save time as the time we process the request
# on the server, rather than when it was made (in case the user's
# clock is not set sensibly and it allows us to associate a time
# zone, even if it is our time zone and not the user's).
#
# For now we save the UTC version of the time and provide no
# way to change this to something meaningful to the user.
#
# Alternatives include:
#
# *  the client could send the time as a string, including the
#    time zone, but this relies on their clock being okay
#
# *  the client can send in the local timezone info which can
#    then be used to format the server-side derived time
#    Not sure if can trust the time zone offset from the client
#    if can not trust the time itself. Calculating a useful display
#    string from the timezone offset is fiddly.
